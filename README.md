# Butterfly
Design of a Butterfly unit to compute FFT for the course "Digital integrated systems" held by Prof. Maurizio Zamboni in the year 2017/2018 at [Politecnico di Torino](www.polito.it).

The project consists of a datapath and control unit, designed to implement the Cooley-Tukey algorithm for FFT, described in behavioral VHDL.
The control unit is microprogrammed, using implicit addressing scheme and 2-way branches.
